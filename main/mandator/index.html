        <h4>
          Introduction into the typeface
        </h4>
            <p>Mandator is constructed grotesk that takes the circle as the base block. It was created as an exploration of purity and neatness and the same time tension between geometry and legibility.</p>
            <p>The idea stemmed from a desire to create a typeface that would be at the minimalistic peak â€“ the most essential, rational, and modest strokes that are abounding with perfection, harmony and simplicity. I aimed to produce a typeface that feels minimalistic yet disciplined, expresive but not at all in the lively way rather in the austere way. I found the most boring people the most original and distinctive.</p>
            <p>Constructed grotesque are typically characterized by their geometric rigor and heartlessness. Umlike more organic sans-serifs, they favor mathematical consistency over optical nuances. At first sight, it may seem almost too mechanical, but upon closer inspection, subtle adjustments allow for a surprising degree of warmth and personality within its strict framework.</p>
